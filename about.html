            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently a freshman at the University of Oklahoma in the Price college of business pursuing a degree in energy management. Over this past semester I have had the opportunity increase my networking skills by creating bonds with fellow energy management students. This has strengthened my love for energy and gives me hope that in the future I will be able to find sustainable forms of alternative energy. Doing this has also increased my knowledge about internships and I am excited for my upcoming one with Exxon over the summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                People that know me, including classmates and professors, have described me as hardworking and resilient. I have had numerous leadership opportunities through the organizations I belong to. Whether by looking over kids at Victory Family Church or giving my time to Men's glee club or my fraternity, I'm always looking for ways to give back.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll be graduating December of 2023 and dream of working for an energy company. I look forward to pursuing a position that will allow me to power the world in alternative ways. Meanwhile, I will continue to expand my knowledge with an open mind. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to connect, or if you are aware of any potential opportunities for which you think I am appropriate.
